  | Marmalade is an Emacs Lisp package server that allows authors to easily
  | upload their packages. It follows the protocol expected by
  | <code>package.el</code>, the standard Emacs package manager, and so can be
  | used in conjunction with the <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/">official GNU
  | repository</a> or the original <a href="http://tromey.com/elpa">ELPA
  | repository</a>.

p
  | The primary goal of Marmalade is to make it easy to distribute Emacs Lisp
  | code. Because Marmalade uses <code>package.el</code>'s package format, it's
  | easy to package existing Elisp code. In addition, anyone can post packages
  | to Marmalade, either <a href="/packages/new">via the website</a> or <a
  | href="/doc-files/api.7.html">via the API</a>.

p
  | Emacs Lisp is unusual in that there's a lot of code out there that is useful
  | but no longer actively maintained. To make this code more widely available,
  | users are encouraged to upload even packages they didn't write (as long as
  | those packages allow redistribution). Marmalade makes it easy to add the
  | original author as an owner should they take an interest in the package.

  | The Marmalade repo was originally written and run by <a
  | href="http://twitter.com/nex3">Nathan Weizenbaum</a>. He did a
  | fantastic job but no longer has time to run marmalade so he has handed it over 
  | to <a href="http://twitter.com/nicferrier">Nic Ferrier</a>. Nic is the author 
  | of <a href="http://nicferrier.github.com/elnode">Elnode</a>, the EmacsLisp 
  | webserver among other things.

  | If you have a problem with Marmalade please contact Nic, either via 
  | <a href="http://twitter.com/nicferrier">twitter</a> or via <a href="https://github.com/nicferrier/marmalade">Nic's Marmalade repo 
  | on github.</a> Leaving an issue using Github would be really helpful.
